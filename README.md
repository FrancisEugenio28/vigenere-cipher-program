# vigenere-cipher-program
This program performs the Vigenere Cipher which is An encryption and decryption algorithm. It is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, which implies that the cipher alphabet is changed on a regular basis during encryption. As a result, the cipher is less sensitive to cryptanalysis.

# Instruction
Write a program that asks the user for the plaintext (all uppercase letters, no spaces) and the keyword (all uppercase letters) and produce the ciphertext using the Vigenère cipher. Give the output of your program for the following message and key:

(You can try it for yourself)
Message: THISISTHELASTTASKHOORDAY
Key: KNIGHTS
