# vigenere-cipher-program
This program performs the Vigenere Cipher which is An encryption and decryption algorithm. It is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, which implies that the cipher alphabet is changed on a regular basis during encryption. As a result, the cipher is less sensitive to cryptanalysis.
